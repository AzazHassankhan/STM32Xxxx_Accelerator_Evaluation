# Evaluation and performance benchmarking of the STM32G4 internal accelerator units

This project focuses on the evaluation and performance benchmarking of the STM32G4 internal accelerator units, specifically the CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) and the FMAC (Filter Math Accelerator) units. The STM32G4 family by STMicroelectronics boasts these DMA-capable mathematical hardware accelerators, designed for tasks such as fast and precise computation of trigonometric functions and efficient calculation of recursive and non-recursive filters.
